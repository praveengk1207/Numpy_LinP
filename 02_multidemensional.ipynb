    "# Dimensions in Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "- >A **dimension** in arrays refers to one level of array depth, indicating how many `indices are needed to access an element`.\n",
    "- >**Nested arrays** are arrays that have other arrays as their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Arrays\n",
    "- >**0-D Array**: A scalar value with no dimensions (e.g., `5`).\n",
    "- >**1-D Array**: A single level of depth, like a list of values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).\n",
    "- >**2-D Array**: An array of arrays, resembling a matrix (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`).\n",
    "- >**3-D Array**: An array of 2-D arrays, similar to a collection of matrices (e.g., `[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- >Each additional dimension increases the level of complexity` and data representation.\n",
    "- >The number of dimensions determines how data is structured and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting Facts\n",
    "- >**Higher Dimensions**: Arrays can have more than three dimensions, such as `4-D arrays`, which are used in `advanced applications` like `video data` processing.\n",
    "- >**Memory Layout**: The way arrays are stored in memory can differ based on their dimensions, `affecting performance in computations`.\n",
    "- >**Applications**: Multi-dimensional arrays are widely used in `data analysis`, `machine learning`, and `scientific computing`, making them essential in these fields.\n"
