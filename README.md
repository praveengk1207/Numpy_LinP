# Learn in Public: NumPy

Welcome to my Learn in Public initiative! In this project, I am diving into the fundamentals of NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Library:** NumPy
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- **Notebook Interface:** Jupyter Notebook

## Project Goals

- Understand the core functionalities of NumPy.
- Explore array operations, mathematical functions, and data manipulation.
- Share my learning journey and insights with the community.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy jupyter
   ```

4. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Start Learning**: Open a new notebook and start experimenting with NumPy!
